- Economics of efficiency: free market --> can not lead to development of poorer countries.
- Economics of development requires proactive interventions.

Three steps: 1) household farming; 2) export oriented manufacturing; 3) closely controlled finance that supports the first two sectors.

Land reform and household farming has the following three advantages:
1) mobalize a large amount of farmers in a short time, which poorer countries are not short for.
2) feed the people which is important and prerequisite to allow trading.
3) bring in the first export income for the country to kick off industrialisation. 

Manufacturing has two advantages:
1) educates people of productive human skills;
2) more transferrable worldwide compared to services - e.g. a lawyer in China cannot be a lawyer in UK; but a mobile phone in China can still be a mobile phone in UK
However, it needs to be disciplined for exports otherwise the companies will stick to its own interests rather than to advance the country's technologies.
