Since I've read Gregor's book Software Architect Elevator, plus that I am not deeply involved in any cloud related work, I have less takeaway on this book.

My top takeaway is the author explaining the value of automation isn't about efficiency, but the following:
* Speed: Speed is the currency of the digital economy because it enables rapid and inexpensive innovation. Automation usually makes you roll out a feature not 10% faster, but 10 times faster or even 100 times faster.
* Repeatability: You not just do it great once, but each time.
* Resilience: Reduce cognitive load. 
* Transparency.
* Continuous improvement/refinement: Having a repeatable and transparent process is the base condition for continuous improvement: you can see what works well and what doesn't. It reduces relearning. 

Another takeaway which I have read about from Gregor's "first derivative" blog, but in this book he mentioned an actionable instruction to the team: On my team we often reminded ourselves that for each task we have two goals: first, accomplish the task, but also to improve the way it's done in the future.
